# Web Design Landing Page

- A simple landing page created using HTML and CSS.
- `display:flex` was used to position elements.
- `position: absolute` and `z-index` was used to position the right hand side image and `overflow:hidden` was used to crop it. Some other elements of the image were also positioned using `position:absolute`
- `linear-gradient` was used to style backgrounds of the buttons.
